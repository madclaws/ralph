## Things we are not doing (as of now)

- Having a lockfile system for updating .git/HEAD - Can try with Genserver first before trying with a traditional lock system.

- Maybe use a gb_tree/OrderedMap library for keeping the order in Tree object entries

- Not using lockfile for index updation

- ctime_nsec is 0 atp, and that's the only differnece in .git's index and ralph's index.

- We are not calculating SHA1 for a stream of data while writing to index, we're just calculating SHA for entire content at once.

- We are not verifying checksum while loading the index to memory. Can do this later.

- if different files have same content then only one blob is made since hash is made of content, i think this should be fixed.
## Tips and tricks

- To access values from an unordered map, one can use another orderedset to store the keys of the map in order, and later access the map value by iterating through the set values as keys.
Or just use a library which does this ;)

- The binary read/write in ralph is using binary mode rather than text mode using `IO.binread`/ `IO.binwrite`
